# terraform-provider-tfe
This depends on the [terraform-provider-shell](https://github.com/scottwinkler/terraform-provider-shell) plugin because there is no go sdk for tfe. The following resources can be created with this provider:

1) vcs connections
2) organizations
3) teams
4) variables
5) workspaces

If this becomes more popular, then additional resources can be added in the future.
